# Credit_card_transaction-_report
It is the project I made Credit  Card Transactions Dataset using Power BI.

I’m thrilled to share my latest project: Credit Card Transaction Analysis Using Power BI! This project showcases my ability to transform raw financial data into actionable insights through advanced data visualization and analysis.

In this project, I worked with a dataset of credit card transactions to explore spending behavior and identify meaningful patterns. Using Power BI, I designed interactive dashboards that reveal:

--> Transaction volumes over time
--> Breakdowns by spending categories
--> Detection of anomalies that could signal fraud or unusual activity

Key highlights of the project include:

--> Data Preparation: Cleaned and structured the dataset for accurate analysis
--> Dynamic Visualizations: Built intuitive dashboards using Power BI’s robust tools
--> DAX Formulas: Leveraged advanced calculations to uncover deeper insights
--> Storytelling with Data: Presented findings in a clear, impactful way

This project reflects my skills in data analytics, visualization, and problem-solving with real-world applications—such as fraud detection or customer segmentation. I’ve attached the project in PDF form for you to explore. I’d love to hear your thoughts or feedback!
